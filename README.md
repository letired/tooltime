### About:
ToolTime is a mobile-friendly tool sharing webapp designed and developed by [Patrick Scheuchzer](https://github.com/patrick-scheuchzer), [Pascal Kress](https://github.com/wabi69sabi), [Pauline Gaget](https://github.com/lupiane), and [Spencer Bray](https://github.com/letired). This app was built in a one-week sprint during the final weeks of the [Le Wagon](https://lewagon.com/) Berlin bootcamp

We used [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This app was mainly built for the purpose of learning rails.
